'''The Challenge: “The Phone Directory Search”

Create a mini data directory using a List and a Dictionary combined.

1. Create a dictionary called contacts where the Keys are friend names and the Values are their phone numbers (keep phone numbers as strings so the leading 0 doesn’t drop off, e.g., “0821112222”). Fill it with 3 people.

2. Ask the user to input the name of the friend they want to look up.

3. Use a conditional check to see if the name matches a key. If it exists, pull out and print their number: “Found! [Name]’s number is [Number]”.

4. Otherwise, print “Contact not found.”
