'''The Challenge: “The High-Score Tracker Game”
Build an interactive program that continuously asks an arcade player for their game
score.

1. Start an intentional infinite loop using while True:.

2. Inside the loop, ask the user to enter a game score next to the flashing cursor.

3. If they type the word “stop” (clean it up with .strip().lower()), print “Game session ended!” and use a break statement to shut down the loop.

4. Otherwise, cast their input into an int, check if the score is greater than 100, and print either “Wow! That’s a new high score!” or “Good try, keep playing!” based on the value.
